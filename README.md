## General Information
- Create, update and delete transactions.
- I built this application to practice DOM manipulation with my JavaScript skills, and fethcing data from a backend API.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript
Ruby on Rails

## Usage
* Clone this backend repository to your machine    https://github.com/iamme24cl/expense-tracker-backend
* Run `bundle` to install all gems listed in the gemfile
* Run `rails db:create && db:migrate` to create and migrate the database (If you are on a windows machine, you will need to make sure your PostgreSQL server is running. You can easily manage this in the PGAdmin desktop application.)
* Run `rails s` to run the server
* On Your front-end folder navigate to your index.html file and open it in your browser to run the front end.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ . I intend to add more features to this application as I learn new skills.
